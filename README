**Builder** is a flexible build system and task runner that leverages [TOML](https://toml.io/) for configuration. It serves as an alternative to traditional tools like [Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) or [Task](https://taskfile.dev/), allowing you to define your build processes and tasks in a more readable and maintainable format.

### Usage
1. Clone the project: `git clone https://github.com/ImSumire/Builder`
2. Change directory: `cd Builder`
3. Edit the content: `nano project.toml`
4. Run commands: `dist/main build`
